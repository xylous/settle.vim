Section 1: Usage                                                *SettleVimUsage*

settle.vim is a wrapper around `settle` (https://github.com/xylous/settle).

settle.vim exports the following commands:

    `:SettleNew` accepts two arguments: the first is the project (as per settle
v0.36.0), the second is the title of the zettel. It creates a new file using
settle and then opens it for you to edit. NOTE: since is a user-defined
function, arguments are separated by commas.

    `:SettleNewUnderLink` doesn't accept any argument: instead, it yanks the text in
the (ASSUMED) wiki-style link under cursor and runs `:SettleNew`. The resulting
Zettel is placed in the root of the Zettelkasten directory.

    `:SettleNewInteractive` accepts no arguments. When ran, it prompts the user
for the project and the title of the Zettel you want. If the title is empty, it
aborts. Otherwise, it runs `:SettleNew` with the specified parameters

    `:SettleEdit` opens FZF in the main Zettelkasten directory.

    `:SettleFollow` follows the wikilink under the cursor, if it exists

Additionally, a wikilink text object is defined. It only uses `il` (inside
link), which selects everything between `[[` and a matching `]]`. Make sure that
you're on the same line as the beginning `[[`, or else it won't select what you
want.

    `:SettleGraph` works only if you have xdot installed. Practically, it uses
    that app to open/read a graph of the entire Zettelkasten.
